## Welcome to EmojiYear

An app which lets you record your dayâ€™s feelings using emojis and view past records. You can record your day by taking a selfie. MLCore will automatically detect your feelings (you will be given a choice to edit them) and assign an emoji for that day. At the end of every year/month/week we generate a photo containing all the emojis.
